"<voice name=\"peter_griffin\">Hey Lois, did you ever wonder what would happen if Object Oriented Programming, y’know, like, the actual concept, came alive and just tried to, I dunno, order a coffee? <break time=\"300ms\"/> Picture this: a big ol’ walking class diagram with a tie strolls into Starbucks and says, <emphasis level=\"strong\">\"Yeah, I’ll have a Grande Inheritance with a shot of Polymorphism, hold the static methods.\"</emphasis> <break time=\"400ms\"/> But the barista’s like, <prosody rate=\"fast\">\"Uh, sir, we don’t serve abstract ideas here.\"</prosody> <break time=\"300ms\"/> Instantly, everything at the counter starts malfunctioning! The espresso machine throws a NullPointerException, and some JavaBeans try to unionize. <break time=\"350ms\"/> Now everyone in line is trying to encapsulate their feelings, but nobody can access them ’cause they’re private variables. <emphasis level=\"strong\">Classic.</emphasis> <break time=\"400ms\"/> OOP gets desperate and starts <voice emotion=\"excited\">instantiating croissants with new()!</voice> Next thing you know, there’s a BakeryOverloadException and the manager shouts, <emphasis level=\"strong\">\"That’s it! I’m switching to Functional Coffee!\"</emphasis> <break time=\"500ms\"/> So remember, kids, if you see object-oriented anything at a café, just let ’em have their decaf interface and hope you don’t get stuck in an infinite brew loop. <emphasis level=\"strong\">Alright, I’m going back to C++; at least there, the coffee’s virtual!</emphasis> <break time=\"200ms\"/> Heh heh, got ’em!</voice>"
