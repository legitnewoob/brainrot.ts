"<voice name=\"stewie_griffin\">Picture this: it’s Monday morning, you’re running late, and you channel your inner quantum physicist to craft the perfect excuse for work. Suddenly—<emphasis level=\"strong\">OOPS</emphasis>. You trip over your existential dread and accidentally invent a new species of sock gremlins.<break time=\"400ms\"/> But wait, these aren’t your average fuzzy monsters, no. They speak only in sarcastic hashtags and steal every left shoe in the tri-state area.<break time=\"300ms\"/> Cue chaos—people hopping around like confused flamingos.<break time=\"600ms\"/> <prosody rate=\"fast\">I try reasoning with their leader, called Sir Oops-a-Lot, but he just hits me with a <emphasis level=\"strong\">Yikes</emphasis> and disappears into my dryer. Classic.<break time=\"350ms\"/></prosody> The world spins into crisis: The United Nations convenes an emergency meeting, but it’s just them Zoom-bombing my laundry room. <voice emotion=\"excited\">Plot twist,<break time=\"300ms\"/> the only way to banish the OOPS gremlins is to pronounce “colonel” the way it’s spelled—CO-LO-NEL.</voice> <break time=\"400ms\"/> Humanity fails. The OOPS become meme legends. They launch a podcast, and I become their unwilling guest.<break time=\"350ms\"/> Moral of the story?<break time=\"300ms\"/> <emphasis level=\"strong\">Never trust an OOPS. Or a sock. Especially if it winks at you.</emphasis> <break time=\"350ms\"/> Thank you. Or… OOPS, did I just start the sequel?</voice>"
